pivoter() is a light weight shiny shell around some basic plotting tools (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly) and pandas pd.pivot_table function.   
What it attempts to do:

1. Read a .csv file in
2. Create a pivot table based on user's choice of variables, and filters
3. Complex compound row names
4. Plot the pivot table
5. Minimal guard rails 
Early developement/proof of concept stage code.
